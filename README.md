CODE PRINCIPLES/BEST PRACTICES

I strife to use these principles in my code:
1. I don't use global values.
2. The names of constructor objects always start with a capital letter.
3. Other variables and functions use camel casing.
4. Comments are used when applicable.
5. Animation is present in CSS files.
6. My code is DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself.
7. <script src=filename.js> tags should be placed as late in the body of the html file as possible.
8. Indentation: I Use tabs, no spaces.
9. I Always use var when creating a new variable.
10. I don't end arrays or objects with a , .
11. A name can only use the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9. _ - . $ and / are forbidden.
12. Varbible names and comments are written in English.
12. I should have fun writing the code I write!
